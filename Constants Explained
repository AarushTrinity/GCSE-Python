# Constants Explained

# Contants look a bit like variables

#but, other constants are declared in FULL CAPS

# For Example

THREEPOINTSHOT = 3
FREE_THROW = 1

# When programmer see a constant

#It tells them not to change the value

# to display the value in the constant, the code is:

print(THREEPOINTSHOT)
